# MySQLTuner-perl Roadmap

This document outlines the future development plans for MySQLTuner-perl. It is a living document that will be updated as the project evolves. The goal is to provide a clear vision of the project's direction and to encourage community contributions.

## Code Quality and Maintainability

- **Refactor the codebase:** Break down the monolithic script into smaller, more manageable modules. This will improve readability, testability, and maintainability.
- **Improve test coverage:** Implement a comprehensive test suite to ensure the script's reliability and prevent regressions.
- **Enhance documentation:** Improve the internal documentation to make it easier for new contributors to understand the codebase.
- **Adopt modern Perl practices:** Update the code to use modern Perl idioms and features, which can improve performance and readability.

## Expanded Support

- **Cloud-based services:** Add support for popular cloud-based MySQL services, such as Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, and Microsoft Azure Database for MySQL.
- **New storage engines:** Add support for new and emerging storage engines, such as MyRocks and Spider.
- **Containerized environments:** Improve support for Docker and Kubernetes environments.

## Enhanced Analysis and Recommendations

- **More granular recommendations:** Provide more specific and actionable recommendations, tailored to the user's specific workload and environment.
- **Historical data analysis:** Collect and analyze historical data to identify trends and provide more accurate recommendations.
- **Machine learning-based recommendations:** Explore the use of machine learning to provide more intelligent and predictive recommendations.

## User Experience

- **Improved output formats:** Add more output formats, such as HTML and JSON, to make the script's output easier to read and parse.
- **Interactive mode:** Add an interactive mode that guides users through the tuning process and provides more context for the recommendations.
- **Graphical user interface (GUI):** Create a GUI to make the script more user-friendly and accessible to a wider audience.

## Community and Contribution

- **Improve the contribution process:** Make it easier for new contributors to get involved by providing clear contribution guidelines and a welcoming community.
- **Create a public roadmap:** Share the project's roadmap publicly to encourage community feedback and contributions.
- **Organize community events:** Host online events, such as hackathons and webinars, to engage the community and encourage contributions.
