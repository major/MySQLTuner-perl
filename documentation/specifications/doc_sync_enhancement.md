# Documentation Synchronization Enhancement

## Goal

Automate synchronization between `mysqltuner.pl`, `README.md`, `INTERNALS.md`, and `.agent/README.md` to ensure indicator counts, version strings, and usage instructions remain 100% consistent.

## 🧠 Rationale

To maintain high-quality, professional standards, all project documentation (READMEs, Roadmaps, Potential Issues, and internal script comments) must be synchronized with the latest functional changes and versioning. This prevents "documentation rot" and ensures users and contributors always have the most accurate information.

## 🛠️ Implementation

### 1. Workflow Update

The `/doc-sync` workflow in `.agent/workflows/doc-sync.md` will be expanded to include explicit steps for:

- Updating English and international `README.md` files.
- Synchronizing usage information with `CLI_METADATA`.
- Updating `ROADMAP.md` based on completed features in `Changelog`.
- Auditing `POTENTIAL_ISSUES` to ensure resolved items are marked or removed.
- Ensuring script comments (internal documentation) accurately reflect logic changes.

### 2. Synchronization Checklist

A new "Synchronization Checklist" will be added to the workflow to ensure:

- `CURRENT_VERSION.txt` matches `mysqltuner.pl` `$tunerversion`.
- `Changelog` header matches the current version and date.
- `releases/v[VERSION].md` exists and summarizes the release correctly.
- All versioned POD documentation in `mysqltuner.pl` is updated.

## ✅ Verification

- Manual verification of documentation consistency.
- Successful execution of `doc_sync.py`.
- Validation of version strings across all 5 mandatory locations (CURRENT_VERSION.txt, script header, $VERSION variable, POD, Changelog).

## Verification

- Validated via `build/doc_sync.pl` and unit test `tests/doc_sync.t`.
- Ensures `.agent/README.md` is updated cleanly.
