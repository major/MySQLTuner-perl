How many old rows must accumulate in the mysql.gtid_slave_pos table before a background job will be run to delete them. Can be increased to reduce number of commits if using many different engines with --gtid_pos_auto_engines, or to reduce CPU overhead if using a huge number of different gtid_domain_ids. Can be decreased to reduce number of old rows in the table.","0","2147483647","1","NULL","NO","REQUIRED","NULL""MYSQL56_TEMPORAL_FORMAT","NULL","ON","COMPILE-TIME","ON","GLOBAL","BOOLEAN","Use MySQL-5.6 (instead of MariaDB-5.3) format for TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP columns.","NULL","NULL","NULL","OFF,ON","NO","OPTIONAL","NULL""REPLICATE_WILD_IGNORE_TABLE","NULL","","COMPILE-TIME","","GLOBAL","VARCHAR","Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the tables that match the given wildcard pattern.","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","NO","NULL","NULL""THREAD_POOL_EXACT_STATS","NULL","OFF","COMPILE-TIME","OFF","GLOBAL","BOOLEAN","If set to 1, provides better statistics in information_schema threadpool tables","NULL","NULL","NULL","OFF,ON","NO","OPTIONAL","NULL""MAX_SEEKS_FOR_KEY","4294967295","4294967295","COMPILE-TIME","4294967295","SESSION","BIGINT UNSIGNED","Limit assumed max number of seeks when looking up rows based on a key","1","4294967295","1","NULL","NO","REQUIRED","NULL""DEADLOCK_TIMEOUT_SHORT","10000","10000","COMPILE-TIME","10000","SESSION","BIGINT UNSIGNED","Short timeout for the two-step deadlock detection (in microseconds)","0","4294967295","1","NULL","NO","REQUIRED","NULL""INNODB_CHECKSUM_ALGORITHM","NULL","full_crc32","COMPILE-TIME","full_crc32","GLOBAL","ENUM","The algorithm InnoDB uses for page checksumming.
