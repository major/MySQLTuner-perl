How many old rows must accumulate in the mysql.gtid_slave_pos table before a background job will be run to delete them. Can be increased to reduce number of commits if using many different engines with --gtid_pos_auto_engines, or to reduce CPU overhead if using a huge number of different gtid_domain_ids. Can be decreased to reduce number of old rows in the table.","0","2147483647","1","NULL","NO","REQUIRED","NULL""ARIA_LOG_PURGE_TYPE","NULL","immediate","COMPILE-TIME","immediate","GLOBAL","ENUM","Specifies how Aria transactional log will be purged","NULL","NULL","NULL","immediate,external,at_flush","NO","REQUIRED","NULL""LOG_BIN","NULL","OFF","COMPILE-TIME","NULL","GLOBAL","BOOLEAN","Whether the binary log is enabled","NULL","NULL","NULL","OFF,ON","YES","NULL","NULL""MYSQL56_TEMPORAL_FORMAT","NULL","ON","COMPILE-TIME","ON","GLOBAL","BOOLEAN","Use MySQL-5.6 (instead of MariaDB-5.3) format for TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP columns.","NULL","NULL","NULL","OFF,ON","NO","OPTIONAL","NULL""MAX_SEEKS_FOR_KEY","4294967295","4294967295","COMPILE-TIME","4294967295","SESSION","BIGINT UNSIGNED","Limit assumed max number of seeks when looking up rows based on a key","1","4294967295","1","NULL","NO","REQUIRED","NULL""THREAD_POOL_EXACT_STATS","NULL","OFF","COMPILE-TIME","OFF","GLOBAL","BOOLEAN","If set to 1, provides better statistics in information_schema threadpool tables","NULL","NULL","NULL","OFF,ON","NO","OPTIONAL","NULL""KEY_CACHE_SEGMENTS","NULL","0","COMPILE-TIME","0","GLOBAL","BIGINT UNSIGNED","The number of segments in a key cache","0","64","1","NULL","NO","REQUIRED","NULL""DEADLOCK_TIMEOUT_SHORT","10000","10000","COMPILE-TIME","10000","SESSION","BIGINT UNSIGNED","Short timeout for the two-step deadlock detection (in microseconds)","0","4294967295","1","NULL","NO","REQUIRED","NULL""LOG_SLOW_FILTER","admin,filesort,filesort_on_disk,filesort_priority_queue,full_join,full_scan,query_cache,query_cache_miss,tmp_table,tmp_table_on_disk","admin,filesort,filesort_on_disk,filesort_priority_queue,full_join,full_scan,query_cache,query_cache_miss,tmp_table,tmp_table_on_disk","COMPILE-TIME","admin,filesort,filesort_on_disk,filesort_priority_queue,full_join,full_scan,query_cache,query_cache_miss,tmp_table,tmp_table_on_disk","SESSION","SET","Log only certain types of queries to the slow log.
