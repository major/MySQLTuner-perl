# **🧠 REMEMBERS & DYNAMIC RULES**

## 🧠 Rationale

High-density agentic development requires a persistent memory of emerging patterns and constraints that haven't yet been formalized in the core constitution.

## 🛠️ Implementation

If new rules are identified during a session, invoke the `/hey-agent` workflow to formalize them in this file.

**REMEMBER LOG:**

- (No active rules - all patterns promoted to Tier 04)

## ✅ Verification

- Periodically migrate stabilized rules from here to `04_best_practices.md` using the `/hey-agent` workflow.
