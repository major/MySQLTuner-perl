## **2\. 🎯 OPERATIONAL OBJECTIVE**

$$DYNAMIC\_CONTEXT$$

* **Status:** \[IN PROGRESS\]  
* **Priority Task:** Maintain and enhance `mysqltuner.pl`, a Perl script for MySQL/MariaDB database performance tuning. Ensure single-file architecture and high reliability through automated testing.

**Success Criteria:**

1. **Architecture:** No splitting of the main file; all logic resides in `mysqltuner.pl`.
2. **Quality:** 100% of new features validated through TDD.
3. **Docs:** Keep `README.md` and translations updated with new features and requirements.
4. **Automation:** All tests runnable via `make test-*` or specific test scripts.
5. **Goal:** Provide the most accurate and up-to-date performance tuning recommendations for MySQL-compatible databases.
