# **AI CONTEXT SPECIFICATIONS & PROJECT CONSTITUTION**

## 🧠 Rationale

Establishing an absolute source of truth is critical for maintaining consistency and quality. This constitution ensures all documentation remains professional, beautiful, and highly portable.

## 🛠️ Implementation

$$SYSTEM\_CRITICAL$$
Notice to the Agent: This document constitutes the unique and absolute source of truth for the MT-site project.

**Core Mission:**
Make `MT-site` the most beautiful, accessible, and high-performance documentation hub for MySQLTuner.

**Key Pillars:**

- **Visual Excellence**: Every page must feel premium, using modern dark-mode aesthetics and smooth interactions.
- **Extreme Portability**: The site must remain executable on any standard web server with PHP support. Zero complexity in deployment.
- **Actionable Documentation**: Content must be clear, well-structured, and automatically synchronized with the core script.
- **Production Performance**: Zero layout shifts and sub-100ms navigation for a "native app" feel.

## ✅ Verification

- All UI/UX changes must be reviewed for aesthetic compliance.
- Use `/compliance-sentinel` to audit deviations.
